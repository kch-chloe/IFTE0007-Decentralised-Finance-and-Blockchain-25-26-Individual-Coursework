# CAVE Token — Chateau Access and Vintage Entitlement

## Overview

CAVE is an ERC-20 fungible token representing a tokenised claim on the annual wine revenue stream and direct purchase entitlement rights of Château Margaux, Bordeaux, France. It embeds two independent economic rights within a single token:

- **Revenue distribution right** — pro-rata share of 30% of total annual estate revenue
- **Wine purchase entitlement right** — 20% direct purchase discount for holders of 100+ tokens

Both parameters are hardcoded as immutable constants and cannot be altered after deployment.
