# CAVE Token — Chateau Access and Vintage Entitlement

**Module:** IFTE0007 Decentralised Finance and Blockchain, UCL  
**Network:** Sepolia Testnet  
**Compiler:** Solidity 0.8.0  
**Library:** OpenZeppelin ERC-20

## Overview

CAVE is an ERC-20 fungible token representing a tokenised claim on the annual wine revenue stream and direct purchase entitlement rights of Château Margaux, Bordeaux, France. It embeds two independent economic rights within a single token:

- **Revenue distribution right** — pro-rata share of 30% of total annual estate revenue
- **Wine purchase entitlement right** — 20% direct purchase discount for holders of 100+ tokens

Both parameters are hardcoded as immutable constants and cannot be altered after deployment.

## Contract File

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `contracts/EIP20_CAVE.sol` | Main CAVE token contract — inherits OpenZeppelin ERC-20 |

---

## Key Design Features

- **OpenZeppelin ERC-20** — standard transfer, approve, allowance, and balanceOf functions inherited automatically
- **Decimals = 0** — one token represents one bottle of production — no fractional tokens
- **Vintage year stamping** — `_update()` override stamps each recipient with the current vintage year on every token transfer, preventing previous cycle tokens from claiming current cycle rights
- **Independent rights activation** — entitlement right activated separately from revenue loading via `activateEntitlement()`
- **Immutable constants** — `DISTRIBUTION_PERCENTAGE = 30` and `DISCOUNT_BPS = 2000` cannot be changed by anyone after deployment
